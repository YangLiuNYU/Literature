Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.

爱玛受到敦促，并没有什么不高兴的。她开始看信，当即吃了一惊。她全然没有想到，居然会写得这么好。不仅没有语病，而且从文笔来看，就是出自一个有教养的人之手，也不会让他觉得丢脸。语言虽然平淡无奇，但却刚劲有力，毫不做作，信中表达的情感充分表明写信人为人体面。信写得不长，但却表现了他的通情达理、情真意切、豁达大度、礼貌周全，甚至感情也很细腻。

"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to "Yes," she ought to say "No" directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart."

“哈丽特，我认为有一条总的原则：一个女人要是拿不准该不该接受一个男人的求爱，那她当然应该拒绝他。她要是犹犹豫豫地不愿接受，那她就应该当机立断地拒绝他。这种事不能犹犹豫豫，不能三心二意。”
