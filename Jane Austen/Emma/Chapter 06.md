Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.

爱玛毫不怀疑她已把哈丽特的幻想引上了正确的方向，并把她新近出于虚荣心而产生的感激之情引导到有益的目标上，因为她发现，哈丽特比以前更明确地认识到：埃尔顿先生仪表堂堂，风度翩翩。她一方面采取循循善诱的办法，步步增进埃尔顿先生的倾慕之情，另一方面又满怀信心地抓住每个机会，培养哈丽特对他的好感。她相信，埃尔顿先生即便还没爱上哈丽特，那他也是正在坠入情网。她对他丝毫没有什么怀疑的。他喜欢谈论哈丽特，热烈地赞扬她，爱玛觉得，只要略给点时间，就能水到渠成。哈丽特来哈特菲尔德以后，举止有了明显的长进，埃尔顿先生把这一情况看在眼里，这是一个令人可喜的现象，说明他对哈丽特渐渐有了意思。

The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her to employ him in reading.

开始画像了。哈丽特脸上笑吟吟、红彤彤的，唯恐把握不住姿态和表情，眼见那位艺术家目不转睛地盯着她，硬摆出一副又活泼又甜蜜的神态。怎奈埃尔顿先生焦灼不安地站在爱玛身后，注视着每一笔每一画，真让爱玛没法画下去。爱玛给了他面子，任他随意站在什么地方，只要不碍事就可以看个不停，可是这下还真得结束这种局面了，要求他挪个地方。这时她灵机一动，叫他念书给她们听。
