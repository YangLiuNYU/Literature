Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good–will. 

爱玛心地慈善，穷人有了难处，她不仅给以亲切关怀，出主意想办法，不厌其烦，而且还解囊相助。她了解他们的习性，能体谅他们的愚昧无知和所受诱惑，鉴于他们没受过什么教育，也不幻想他们会有什么异乎寻常的美德。她对他们的困苦充满了同情，总是怀着一片善心，很有见识地给以帮助。
