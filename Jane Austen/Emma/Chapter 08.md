"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour–boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry–out upon her extreme good luck. Even your satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, "Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.""

“跟哈丽特不相配！”奈特利先生愤懑地大声嚷道。过了一会，他冷静了一些，以严厉的口吻说道，“是呀，他还真跟哈丽特不相配呢，无论在身份上还是在才智上，他都胜过哈丽特。爱玛，你对那姑娘太宠爱了，都失去了理智。哈丽特·史密斯在出身、性情和教养上有什么了不起的，居然要攀一个比罗伯特·马丁还强的人？她不知道是什么人的私生女，可能连生计也没有着落，当然更没有体面的亲戚。大家只知道她是一所普通小学的寄宿生，人不聪明，又缺乏见识。别人也没教她点有用的东西，而她自己又年轻又无知，自然也没学到什么本事。她处于这个年龄，不可能有什么经验，加上头脑愚笨，以后也不大可能获得什么有益的经验。她长得漂亮，脾气好，如此而已。我撮合这门亲事只有一个顾虑，就是怕委屈了马丁，给他找一个不般配的人。我觉得，就财产而言，他十有八九可以娶一个比哈丽特有钱得多的姑娘；就找一个明白事理的伴侣和有用的帮手而言，他也不可能娶一个还不如哈丽特的姑娘。但是，跟坠入情网的人是讲不通道理的，因此我就一心指望哈丽特也没有什么坏处，她有那样的好性子，跟着马丁那样的好青年，很容易上进，往好里发展。我觉得这门亲事只是对哈丽特有利。毫无疑问（我现在也毫不怀疑），大家都会说哈丽特真是万幸。我相信就是你也会感到很满意的。我当即想到，你的朋友嫁给这样一个好人家，你不会因为她要离开海伯里而感到惋惜。我记得我自言自语说：‘爱玛尽管十分偏爱哈丽特，她也会觉得这是一门好亲事。’”

"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good–natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety–nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well–informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good–nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess."

“你是马丁先生非常热心的朋友，可是正如我刚才说的，你对哈丽特就不公正了。哈丽特有权利缔结一门好亲事，而并不像你说的那样卑贱。她不算是聪明人，但总比你想象的聪明些，不该把她的智力说得那么低下。不过，撇开这一点且不说，就算她真像你描绘的那样，只是长得漂亮，脾气好，那我可要告诉你，就凭她那样漂亮，脾气那样好，这在世人看来可不是微不足道的优点，因为她实在是一个美女，一百个人里有九十九个都会这样认为。除非男人不像大家想象的那样，对美貌能采取非常达观的态度，除非男人不爱美貌爱才智，那么像哈丽特这样可爱的姑娘，就一定会有人看中她、追求她，一定能够从许多人中加以挑选，因而可以挑三拣四。她的好性子也不是个无足轻重的优点，她那性情举止，还真是十分温柔，十分谦恭，十分讨人喜爱。这样的美貌，这样的性情，你们男人们不将其视为女人最宝贵的条件，那才怪呢。”

"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr. Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour–boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing–master's son."

“我总觉得你们搞得这么亲热是很荒谬的，”奈特利先生马上说道，“不过我一直把这想法埋在心里。现在我认识到，这对哈丽特来说将是很不利的。你总夸她如何漂亮，条件如何好，搞得她忘乎所以了，用不了多久，周围的人她会一个也看不上眼的。头脑简单的人有了虚荣心，那是什么荒唐事都干得出来的。年轻小姐最容易冒出不切实际的幻想。哈丽特·史密斯小姐尽管很漂亮，求婚的人不见得会纷至沓来。不管你怎么说，聪明的男人不会要傻女人做老婆。出身高贵的男人是不大喜欢跟没有名分的姑娘结婚的——十分谨慎的男人担心她父母的秘密一披露出来，他们自己要受连累，搞得很不光彩。她要是嫁给罗伯特·马丁，一辈子都会又平安，又体面，又快活。你要是鼓动她一心就想高攀，唆使她非要嫁给一个有钱有势的人，那她可能要在戈达德太太的学校里寄宿一辈子——或者至少要寄宿到她实在耐不住了，甘愿嫁给一个老书法教师的儿子，因为她终究是要嫁人的。”

Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He walked off in more complete self–approbation than he left for her. She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.

玛也很气恼，然而她又不大清楚她为什么气恼。她不像奈特利先生那样，总是对自己充满自信，绝对相信自己的意见是正确的，别人是错误的。奈特利先生离开时，比来找爱玛时还充满自信。不过，爱玛也不怎么十分沮丧，用不了多久，等哈丽特一回来，她就会恢复常态。哈丽特走了这么久，她真有些忐忑不安了。也许马丁上午真去了戈达德太太家，见到哈丽特，为自己申辩，一想到这些真让她感到可怕。她心里最担心的，还就怕自己的计划落空。后来哈丽特回来了，只见她兴高采烈，也没说因为遇见马丁耽搁了这么久，她不禁感到很满意，也放下了心，觉得不管奈特利先生怎么想怎么说，她所作的一切都是基于女人的情谊，因而是正当的。

Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, "that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness."
 
纳什小姐把这事一五一十地讲给爱玛听了，还讲了埃尔顿先生的许多情况。最后，她意味深长地看着爱玛，说道：“我不敢妄加猜测他有什么事，可是我心里有数，凡是他看中的女人，我想一定是世界上最幸运的人；因为毫无疑问，埃尔顿先生又英俊又可爱，谁也比不上他。”
