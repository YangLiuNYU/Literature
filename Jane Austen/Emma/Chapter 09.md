"This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them."

“不管你的朋友是什么人，只要起码有点头脑，就会觉得这是一起良缘，而我们也不用把我们的事说给傻瓜听。如果你那些朋友急于想看见你幸福地嫁人，这里就有一个人，他性情和蔼可亲，能百分之百地确保你幸福；如果他们希望把你安置在一个合他们心意的区域圈子里，这里就能实现他们的心愿；如果用通俗的话讲，他们的目标就是要叫你结一门好亲事，那这里就是个体面的归宿，让你有足够的财产，保你出人头地，他们一定会很满意。”

After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.

说完这话，他就急忙走了。爱玛也巴不得他快走，虽说他有很多讨人喜欢的地方，但他说起话来有些咋咋呼呼，真让她忍俊不禁。她跑到一旁去笑个痛快，让哈丽特沉浸在温馨、美妙的迷梦之中。
